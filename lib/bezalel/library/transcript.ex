defmodule Bezalel.Library.Transcript do
  @moduledoc """
  A conversation's transcript is its rho session (`Rho.Session`, pi's
  JSONL): this module reads the chat's messages off a branch of it and
  plans the branch edits behind Delete and Undo. Pure; `Bezalel.Library`
  does the reading and writing.

  **Messages.** On the active branch, each user `message` entry is a user
  message; the entries between two of them (the model's turns, tool
  results, the loop's notices) are one reply (`Bezalel.Library.Message`).
  A live reply's blocks are rebuilt from its entries by the fold that drew
  it while it streamed (`Bezalel.Agent.Reply`): each turn's thinking, each
  tool call with its result, the answer as the SUMMARY; its passage card
  comes from the tool result's kept `details` (`Bezalel.Agent.Live` keeps
  the card there). A reply Bezalel wrote itself (the storyboard's, or one
  moved over from the old messages table) is one assistant message whose
  text is its summary, for the model, and whose `"bezalel"` field holds
  what the chat shows (`blocks`, `passage`, `card`, `image`, `model`);
  pi and rho ignore the field.

  **Delete and Undo are branch moves.** Deleting messages branches from
  the entry before the first of them and copies the entries after it,
  minus the deleted ones, onto the new branch (nothing to copy when it was
  the last message). The old branch stays in the file. Undo goes back to
  the branch before the delete, plus copies of anything added since. A
  move with nothing to copy appends a `custom` entry (`"bezalel.branch"`)
  under the entry it moves to, since the last entry in the file is the
  leaf; `custom` entries never reach a model.
