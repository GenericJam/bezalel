defmodule Bezalel.Study.DB do
  @moduledoc """
  Read-only access to the study packs (`data/README.md`): `core`, `notes`,
  `lxx`, `ancient` and `graph`, one SQLite file each in `dir/0`.

  Every call opens its own read-only connection to the one pack it needs
  and closes it when done (`with_pack/2`), so:

    * calls are independent: rho runs a reply's tool calls in parallel, and
      no connection or statement is shared between processes;
    * a pack downloaded or replaced while the app runs is used from the next
      call, with no connection to reopen or repo to restart;
    * a missing pack is found per call and reported as text the model can
      act on (`missing/1`).

  Opening a pack costs about a millisecond on a Mac, small beside a tool
  call's model round trip. Exqlite is used directly rather than through a
  second Ecto repo: the tools run fixed SQL over a fixed schema, and a
  pooled repo would hold connections open across pack downloads and need
  `ATTACH` on every pooled connection for the packs present at the time.
